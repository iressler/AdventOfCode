# AdventOfCode
My solutions in Swift to the Advent of Code challenges.

This repository contains an Xcode project that creates a Command Line Tool (and copies it into your `$HOME` directory after building).

You can find the individual solutions in the [ChallengeSolvers](./AdventOfCode/ChallengeSolvers) directory.
